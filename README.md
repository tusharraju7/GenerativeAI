### Machine Learning with Hugging Face Transformers
This repository contains a detailed Jupyter notebook designed to demonstrate advanced machine learning techniques using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The notebook guides you through the process of mounting a Google Drive for data access, installing necessary Python packages, and setting up data structures for training a DistilBert model.

**Key Features:**
1. Environment Setup: Instructions for setting up Google Colab and mounting Google Drive.
2. Library Installation: Steps to install and import essential libraries including Hugging Face Transformers.
3. Model Training and Fine-Tuning: Implementation of a training loop, with detailed management of training parameters and validation to prevent overfitting.
4. Model Evaluation: Code to evaluate the model on a test set and report accuracy using sklearn's metrics.

**Objective:**
The project aims to provide hands-on experience in fine-tuning and evaluating NLP models, specifically focusing on understanding the implementation details of neural networks in real-world scenarios.

This repository is ideal for students and developers looking to enhance their skills in machine learning and natural language processing.
